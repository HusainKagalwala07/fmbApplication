#### API first, meaning API will be driving force for application, API will be developed in Robust manner so that  FMB in any city can configure application as per their need.
#### We will provide general UI, however with well designed API any custom UI Can be developed.
#### If required GraphQL Can be Use for performance and clean UI- API interation.
## Developer Notes
#### Applicaton consist of 
- api:Backend Server that is responsible for communicating with Database and external services.
- frontend:Web based application that will allow users to perform day today task realted to fmb
## Technologies
- DB (Mongo DB)
- Spring Boot (API And Business Logic Layer)
- ReactJs (Progressive Mobile App)
